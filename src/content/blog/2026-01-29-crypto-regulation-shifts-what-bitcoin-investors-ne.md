**TL;DR:** The Trump administration is dramatically reshaping cryptocurrency regulation with pro-crypto legislation, SEC enforcement rollbacks, and a comprehensive stablecoin framework, while Congress prepares major market infrastructure bills.

**Key takeaways**

- The SEC dropped nearly all enforcement actions against crypto firms from the Biden era, signaling a fundamental regulatory pivot toward industry flexibility[3]
- Congress is advancing cryptocurrency tax legislation and a "market infrastructure" bill to create comprehensive regulatory clarity for digital asset trading[2][3]
- The GENIUS Act established the first federal stablecoin framework, legitimizing payment stablecoins as a separate asset class outside securities and commodities rules[3]

## Regulatory Landscape Transforms Overnight

The cryptocurrency industry experienced a seismic regulatory shift in 2025 that's reshaping 2026 policy. The SEC dropped nearly all enforcement actions commenced under the Biden administration against fintech companies based on allegations of unregistered broker-dealer, issuance, exchange, or clearing agency activities[3]. This represents a complete reversal from the previous administration's enforcement-heavy approach that effectively discouraged traditional financial institutions from participating in digital asset markets.

The Trump administration's Working Group on Digital Assets issued recommendations designed to strengthen American leadership in crypto and make the United States the "crypto capital of the world."[3] Banking regulators withdrew prior guidance constraining bank participation in digital assets and adopted new guidance expanding these capabilities. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency granted fintech firms national trust bank charters, enabling deeper integration with distributed ledger technology[3].

## Stablecoins Get Federal Framework

Congress enacted the GENIUS Act, establishing the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins[3]. The legislation clarifies that permitted payment stablecoins are neither securities, commodities, nor deposits, but instead operate under a separate regulatory regime administered by the OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve, Treasury, and state banking regulators. This framework is expected to legitimize stablecoins and integrate them into everyday U.S. financial transactions.

## Tax Legislation on the Horizon

Cryptocurrency tax legislation is very likely in 2026, with both the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee holding hearings on the topic[2]. The Trump administration published a 166-page White Paper proposing that cryptocurrency be treated as a distinct asset class subject to rules similar to securities and commodities, including mark-to-market elections and trading safe harbors[2].

A Discussion Draft incorporating many White Paper proposals represents the first comprehensive attempt at cryptocurrency tax legislation since the 2022 Lummis-Gillibrand bill[2]. The administration also nullified the controversial DeFi broker reporting regulations from the Biden era and clarified that only businesses effecting sales transactions—such as cryptocurrency ATMs—are subject to broker reporting rules[2].

## Market Infrastructure Bill Expected

Congress appears poised to adopt a "market infrastructure" bill that would establish comprehensive regulatory regimes for digital asset brokers, dealers, and exchanges[3]. This legislation would bring greater clarity to when crypto transactions may be regulated as securities offerings. The SEC is expected to continue adopting no-action relief and guidance, potentially including an "innovation exemption" creating regulatory sandboxes for digital asset services[3].

## What to do next

As regulatory clarity improves, now is an excellent time to evaluate your Bitcoin security posture. While institutional adoption accelerates through ETFs and banking integration, individual investors should prioritize self-custody for long-term holdings. Consider using a hardware wallet like those offered by **[Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a)** to maintain direct control of your private keys—a critical practice as the regulatory environment stabilizes and more financial institutions enter the space. Monitor the progress of pending tax and infrastructure legislation, as these will directly impact your reporting obligations and trading strategies in 2026.
