## Major Regulatory Breakthroughs

US Congress and the White House intensify efforts to pass the **Clarity Act**, aiming to define jurisdictional lines between SEC and CFTC for digital assets.[1][6] SEC Chair Paul Atkins testified on February 11 before the House Financial Services Committee, voicing strong support and readiness to implement the act.[6] This "future-proofs" regulations beyond mere guidance, with Atkins highlighting coordination via Project Crypto.[6]

The CFTC updated its **stablecoin definition** and formed the CEO Innovation Council under its "Crypto Sprint" through August 2026.[1][3] Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham emphasizes industry collaboration for spot trading, tokenized collateral, and stablecoin rules.[3] Meanwhile, the SEC cracks down on AI-powered fraud like deepfakes while exploring tokenized securities frameworks.[3][5]

Globally, Hong Kong's stablecoin regime, effective since August 2025, issues licenses incrementally with strict AML/CFT via blockchain analytics.[1] China upholds its stablecoin ban, while EU's MiCA and DAC8 roll out in Spain by mid-2026, boosting tax reporting and ending anonymity.[1][3] Brazil advances VASP rules under Central Bank Resolutions 519-521.[4]

State-level moves include West Virginia Senate advancing crypto kiosk regulations for consumer protection.[2]

## ETF Flows and Institutional Adoption Surge

Specific **ETF flow data** for this week remains sparse, but broader 2026 trends show institutional confidence amid Bitcoin's 30% February decline.[10] Nobody panics as "institutional rails" solidify, with the GENIUS Act enabling federal stablecoin frameworks.[10]

SEC and CFTC's September 2025 joint statement launched a cross-agency clarity initiative, now expanding into a **Harmonization Initiative** for digital asset taxonomy.[4][5][7] The SEC terminated many enforcement actions, including against Coinbase, and rescinded anti-crypto bank guidance from FRB, OCC, and FDIC.[5] Banking regulators now accommodate crypto custody.[5]

An "innovation exemption" looms, allowing new products during approvals, while tokenized green bonds pilot in Hong Kong.[5][6] Spain's BBVA and Cecabank stay MiCA-compliant, signaling institutional buy-in despite strict rules.[3] Basel Committee mandates bank disclosures on virtual assets from 2026, with proof-of-reserves for VASPs.[4]

US Treasury/IRS rules expand broker reporting, aligning with global tax exchanges.[4] White House hosted a second crypto meeting on stablecoin yields.[6]

## Practical Self-Custody Advice

Secure your Bitcoin with **self-custody** to avoid exchange risks amid rising regulations. Start by buying a hardware wallet like **Ledger**, which stores private keys offline for top security—get yours at [https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a). Generate a seed phrase on the device, never share it, and test recoveries.

Practice small transfers first, enable passphrases for extra protection, and use multisig for larger holdings. Update firmware regularly and store backups in fireproof safes across locations. Regulators demand custody reforms, so self-custody empowers you against VASP compliance shifts.[4][5]
