## Major Regulatory Breakthroughs

US regulators delivered pro-crypto shifts this week. The SEC replaced SAB 121 with SAB 122, allowing banks more flexibility in recording crypto custody assets on balance sheets, slashing costs for firms like custodians holding Bitcoin.[1] This opens doors for major banks to offer Bitcoin custody services previously hindered by capital requirements.

The SEC also terminated most enforcement actions against crypto firms, dropping the high-profile Coinbase case alleging unregistered securities sales.[1] Separately, the Department of Justice announced it will no longer target exchanges for users' "unwitting" violations like Bank Secrecy Act breaches, focusing only on fraud or terrorism.[1] Treasury removed sanctions on Tornado Cash, previously accused of laundering over $7 billion including North Korean hacks.[1]

Banking agencies—FRB, OCC, and FDIC—rescinded anti-crypto guidance, encouraging banks to engage with Bitcoin firms.[1] The SEC launched a Crypto Task Force for a clear framework and proposed an "innovation exemption" for new products.[1][3]

## CLARITY Act Progress and Global Updates

Congress and the White House ramped up efforts on the CLARITY Act, a market structure bill passed by the House last year.[2][4] Early February meetings addressed disputes over banning stablecoin interest payments by exchanges, with banks pushing restrictions while Coinbase threatened to pull support.[2] No deal emerged, stalling Senate advancement ahead of midterms.[2][4]

The SEC and CFTC initiated a Harmonization Initiative to define jurisdictions and a digital asset taxonomy, prioritizing tokenized securities on Bitcoin-like networks.[1][3] CFTC's "Crypto Sprint" advances spot listings and tokenized collateral use.[3] Globally, Hong Kong gears up for March stablecoin licenses with strict AML rules, while China reaffirmed its stablecoin ban.[2]

These moves reduce ambiguity, potentially boosting Bitcoin's role in tokenized assets.[1][3]

## ETF Flows and Institutional Adoption

Search results highlight regulatory tailwinds driving institutional interest, though specific week-over-week ETF flow data remains sparse. Eased custody rules via SAB 122 position banks to expand Bitcoin ETF services, following 2025's spot ETF approvals.[1] CFTC updates affirm stablecoins as collateral, aiding derivatives tied to Bitcoin ETFs.[2][3]

Institutional adoption accelerates with no-action relief for tokens like those from Fuse Crypto and DoubleZero, signaling SEC openness.[3] The GENIUS Act's stablecoin rules, effective 2027, permit OCC-chartered banks to issue and custody, drawing firms toward Bitcoin-integrated products.[1][2] Expect major inflows as clarity emerges.

## What to do next

Bitcoin holders should seize this regulatory clarity by prioritizing self-custody to avoid third-party risks amid evolving rules. Use a hardware wallet like **Ledger** for secure offline storage—generate a seed phrase, never share it, and verify transactions on trusted nodes. Shop Ledger devices at [https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a) and practice multisig setups for added protection. Monitor CLARITY Act updates for custody impacts.
