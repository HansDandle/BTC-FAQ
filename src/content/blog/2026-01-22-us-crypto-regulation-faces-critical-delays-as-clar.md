**TL;DR:** The Senate Banking Committee postponed its markup of the landmark CLARITY Act due to over 100 contentious amendments, creating uncertainty about US crypto regulation and threatening the industry's push for comprehensive federal oversight before the 2026 midterm elections.

**Key takeaways**

- The CLARITY Act, which passed the House in July 2025 with bipartisan support, faces significant delays after the Senate Banking Committee postponed its January 15 markup session
- A controversial amendment backed by the banking industry to restrict stablecoin yield rewards has fractured industry support, with Coinbase withdrawing backing for the bill
- Lawmakers warn that regulatory delays could cost the US its competitive edge in global crypto markets, with potential two-year consequences if the bill fails before midterm elections

## The CLARITY Act Stalls Over Stablecoin Rewards Dispute

The Senate Banking Committee's unexpected postponement of its CLARITY Act markup on January 14 has thrown the most comprehensive US crypto regulation framework into uncertainty[1]. Over 100 proposed amendments proved too contentious for Chairman Tim Scott to risk a floor vote, forcing a strategic retreat that has left industry participants and policymakers scrambling to navigate the path forward[1].

The most divisive amendment, championed by the banking industry, would amend the recently signed GENIUS Act to prevent cryptocurrency exchanges from paying interest on customer-held stablecoins[1]. This provision directly targets yield-bearing stablecoin products that have become increasingly popular with retail investors seeking returns competitive with traditional banking products. The amendment has created an unprecedented rift: Coinbase, one of the bill's leading advocates, announced it would withdraw support if the provision remains in the legislation[1].

Beyond the stablecoin rewards dispute, other amendments have exposed deeper ideological rifts within the regulatory framework itself. Industry participants remain uncomfortable with provisions defining and regulating decentralized finance (DeFi) innovators and software, fearing insufficient protection from regulatory overreach[1]. These competing visions of how to balance innovation with consumer protection have made consensus elusive.

## Multiple Pathways Forward, But Time Is Running Out

The CLARITY Act now faces four potential trajectories, each with dramatically different implications for US crypto markets[1]. The most optimistic scenario involves the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees resolving contested issues in late January or early February, enabling a full Senate vote and potential law passage in the first half of 2026[1].

However, Senator Cynthia Lummis, who chairs the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, suggested the timeline could stretch to "a couple of months" before another committee attempt[2]. An extended debate scenario could push resolution into spring and summer, though passage would still theoretically remain on track for 2026[1].

The most concerning outcomes include an incremental approach where lawmakers pursue narrow, focused legislation instead of comprehensive reform—undermining market-wide confidence in US regulatory clarity—or a post-midterm delay that pushes the entire process to January 2027[1]. Industry leaders warn that regulatory stagnation carries real consequences: the Blockchain Association's Peter Smith stated that failure to pass CLARITY before midterms would result in "two more years of delay," during which the US risks ceding global crypto market leadership to international competitors[3].

## Global Regulatory Momentum Continues

While US regulation stalls, other jurisdictions are advancing their crypto frameworks. Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority issued new custody guidance for cryptoassets on January 12, reflecting growing institutional demand for secure trading and storage solutions[1]. Dubai's Financial Services Authority implemented its Crypto Token Regulatory Framework the same day, establishing clearer stablecoin definitions and banning privacy tokens on exchanges[1]. India has also tightened Know Your Customer requirements for crypto intermediaries, signaling a shift toward stricter compliance burdens[1].

These international developments underscore the competitive pressure facing US policymakers. The current regulatory vacuum leaves American firms at a disadvantage against jurisdictions offering clearer frameworks and faster implementation timelines.

## What to do next

For cryptocurrency holders navigating this regulatory uncertainty, the priority remains protecting your assets through self-custody. Rather than relying solely on exchange custody during periods of regulatory flux, consider moving significant holdings to a hardware wallet where you control the private keys. This approach eliminates counterparty risk and ensures your assets remain accessible regardless of regulatory changes affecting custodians. For those seeking institutional-grade security, [Ledger hardware wallets](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a) provide an accessible entry point to self-custody with industry-leading security standards. As regulatory clarity remains elusive, maintaining direct control over your crypto assets remains the most prudent strategy.
