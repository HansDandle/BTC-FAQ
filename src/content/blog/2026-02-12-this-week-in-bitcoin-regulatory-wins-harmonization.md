## Major Regulatory Developments

The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which passed the House in July 2025, faced a setback when the Senate Banking Committee delayed its markup on January 14, 2026. Industry leaders withdrew support over revised text concerns, halting momentum despite earlier bipartisan progress[1]. This reveals ongoing tensions in crafting a federal crypto framework.

White House Crypto Policy Council hosted meetings with crypto executives and banks to refine digital asset market structure legislation. No deal emerged, but stakeholders must propose changes ahead of a February 10 follow-up[4]. Treasury Secretary Bessent urged consensus to advance bills like the GENIUS Act.

The SEC and CFTC launched a Harmonization Initiative, highlighted at a January 29 joint event titled "U.S. Financial Leadership in the Crypto Era." New CFTC Chairman Michael Selig announced Project Crypto to define asset taxonomies, clarify jurisdictions, and enable tokenized collateral and perpetual derivatives[2][3]. Agencies rescinded restrictive guidance like SAB 121, easing bank custody and terminating cases against firms like Coinbase[2].

## ETF Flows and Institutional Momentum

Specific Bitcoin ETF flow data for the week remains sparse in reports, but broader institutional adoption surges under friendlier regs. Banks gain flexibility via SAB 122, allowing discretionary liability recording for crypto custody and lowering entry barriers[2]. Major institutions eye tokenized securities oversight as SEC develops frameworks[2].

Treasury lifted Tornado Cash sanctions and DOJ ended pursuits of exchanges for user actions absent fraud[2]. CFTC reissued Letter 25-40, expanding "payment stablecoin" definitions for margin collateral in futures[3]. Senate Agriculture advanced a market structure bill on January 29[5].

GENIUS Act implementation accelerates, with Treasury retaining $15B in seized Bitcoin for a strategic reserve—no taxpayer funds used[4]. Bessent's FSOC report to Congress emphasized "deliberate speed," signaling institutional comfort[4].

## Self-Custody Best Practices

Regulatory thaw boosts Bitcoin's appeal, but self-custody protects against exchange risks amid evolving rules. Use hardware wallets to control private keys, avoiding third-party custody vulnerabilities exposed in past hacks. Enable multi-signature setups and seed phrase backups in secure, offline locations.

Practice regular firmware updates and verify transactions on trusted explorers. For robust security, **Ledger hardware wallets** offer proven protection—explore options at [https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a). Test small transfers first to build confidence.

## What to do next

Monitor White House February 10 meeting outcomes and CFTC rulemaking for trading innovations, positioning Bitcoin portfolios accordingly. Diversify into self-custody now: secure keys offline, adopt Ledger for daily use, and stay informed via on-chain analytics to capitalize on institutional inflows.
