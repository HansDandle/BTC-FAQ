## Major US Regulatory Breakthroughs

The American Bankers Association joined crypto leaders at a White House meeting to push forward pending market structure legislation in Congress[1]. This bill builds on last year's Genius Act, which established rules for payment stablecoins, by addressing broader digital assets and closing loopholes allowing crypto firms to offer interest on them[1]. The session signals strong administration support for US leadership in blockchain innovation.

On January 28, SEC divisions released joint guidance clarifying how federal securities laws apply to tokenized securities on blockchains[3]. This comprehensive statement views tokenization as compatible with existing infrastructure, avoiding new frameworks[3]. It aligns with goals to position the US as a global crypto leader.

The CLARITY Act advanced through the Senate Agriculture Committee on January 29 via bipartisan vote, though it faces hurdles in the Senate Banking Committee[3]. ABA pushes amendments to enforce stablecoin interest bans[1][3]. Meanwhile, the SEC's Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, focuses on security status, jurisdiction, and custody paths for digital assets[2].

These steps mark a shift from policy design to implementation, with regulators converging globally on stablecoin rules[4].

## ETF Flows and Institutional Adoption Surge

Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue thriving post-SEC's 2024 omnibus approval for 11 trusts holding actual Bitcoin[2]. Recent SEC orders approve technical updates for crypto products, making them cheaper and more efficient, per Chairman Paul Atkins[2]. This merit-neutral approach supports broader market access.

Institutional adoption has reached irreversibility, driven by non-regulatory forces and global trends[4]. Regulators now prioritize implementation over clarity, especially for stablecoins[4]. In the UK, FCA extends rules to crypto firms ahead of a 2026 gateway, while South Korea overhauls licensing[3].

Australia's ASIC flags unlicensed crypto risks but eases stablecoin distribution[3]. These developments boost confidence, with US harmonization statements eyeing DeFi exemptions for peer-to-peer trading[2].

## What to do next

Bitcoin holders should prioritize self-custody to control private keys and avoid exchange risks amid regulatory flux. Start by transferring assets to a hardware wallet like **Ledger**, which offers top security for cold storage—check out options at [https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a). Verify addresses twice, use multisig for large holdings, and practice seed phrase backups offline to stay sovereign.
