## Major U.S. Regulatory Developments

The U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry unveiled a bipartisan draft in November 2025 granting the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over spot digital commodity markets, including Bitcoin[1]. This Boozman-Booker proposal requires brokers, dealers, custodians, and trading facilities to register with the CFTC, enforcing segregation of customer assets, cybersecurity standards, and conflict-of-interest safeguards akin to traditional markets[1]. Unresolved issues like definitions for "blockchain" and "decentralized finance" persist, with stakeholder feedback ongoing and no markup date set[1].

The SEC advanced custody clarity on September 30, 2025, via a No-Action Letter permitting advisors to hold crypto with State Trust Companies under the Investment Company Act[1]. Chairman Atkins signaled an "innovation exception" rollout in January 2026, delayed by shutdown, while providing Congress guidance on bills like the CLARITY Act[1]. The World Federation of Exchanges warned against exemptions diluting securities protections[1].

Cross-agency efforts intensified with a September 29, 2025, SEC-CFTC roundtable on harmonization through information-sharing and joint exams[1]. The IRS joined on November 10, 2025, issuing Rev. Proc. 2025-31 for trusts to stake crypto while retaining investment trust status[1].

## ETF Flows and Institutional Adoption Updates

Search results lack specific week-ending December 18, 2025, Bitcoin ETF flow data, but broader institutional moves signal adoption. The CFTC launched a Digital Assets Pilot Program allowing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC as collateral for derivatives on regulated markets, easing institutional entry[2]. This pilot underscores Bitcoin's maturing role in traditional finance.

Standard Chartered slashed its year-end 2025 Bitcoin price target to $100,000 from $200,000, citing regulatory and market pressures, while maintaining a $500,000 long-term view post-2030[2]. The SEC's Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, continues focusing on custody, jurisdiction, and token relief since February 2025[3][9].

## Global Regulatory Momentum

The UK government announced on December 15, 2025, new crypto rules to foster growth and protect customers, with Chancellor backing proportionate regulations for crypto firms[5]. The FCA's CP25/40 consultation details these activities regulations[6]. U.S. states also clarified digital asset property rules for perfection and priority[8].

## What to do next

Retail investors should monitor CFTC and SEC updates for trading impacts while prioritizing self-custody to avoid exchange risks amid regulatory shifts. Use a hardware wallet like **Ledger** for secure Bitcoin storage—generate a seed phrase offline, never share it, and verify addresses on-device (https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a). Track ETF flows via on-chain tools like Glassnode and diversify holdings across self-custodied BTC and regulated products.
