**TL;DR:** Buy Bitcoin from a regulated exchange with strong security practices, then transfer to a hardware wallet for long-term storage.

**Key takeaways**

- Use established exchanges with regulatory compliance, insurance, and a track record of security.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use a unique, strong password.
- Move Bitcoin off the exchange to a hardware wallet like [Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a) for long-term holding.

## What to look for in an exchange

Not all exchanges are created equal. Before signing up, check for:

- **Regulatory compliance** — Is the exchange licensed in your jurisdiction? Regulated exchanges are more likely to have proper security and insurance.
- **Security track record** — Has the exchange been hacked? How did they handle it? Look for exchanges that use cold storage for the majority of funds.
- **Fees and spreads** — Compare trading fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, and the spread between buy/sell prices.
- **Payment methods** — Does the exchange support bank transfers, credit cards, or other methods you prefer?

## Popular exchanges for beginners

Several exchanges have earned strong reputations for security and ease of use:

- **Coinbase** — US-based, publicly traded, beginner-friendly interface. Higher fees but good for first-time buyers.
- **Kraken** — Strong security record, lower fees, supports many countries. Good balance of features and cost.
- **Gemini** — US-regulated, insured, clean interface. Popular with security-conscious users.
- **River** — Bitcoin-only, US-based, automatic recurring buys. Great for long-term stackers.

Research each option and choose based on your location, payment preferences, and fee tolerance.

## What to do next

1. **Choose an exchange** — Pick one that's available in your country and meets your needs.
2. **Verify your identity** — Most regulated exchanges require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.
3. **Enable 2FA** — Use an authenticator app (not SMS) for two-factor authentication.
4. **Start small** — Make a small test purchase to learn the process.
5. **Withdraw to self-custody** — Once you're comfortable, transfer your Bitcoin to a hardware wallet like the [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a) for secure long-term storage.

Don't leave significant amounts on an exchange. Exchanges can be hacked, freeze accounts, or go bankrupt. Your keys, your coins.
