## Regulatory Breakthroughs Reshape Crypto Landscape

US regulators solidified a pro-innovation stance this week. The SEC's Crypto Task Force balances privacy with transparency, while providing no-action relief to issuers like Fuse Crypto and DoubleZero, signaling tokens may not always qualify as securities.[1] CFTC advanced its "Crypto Sprint" by approving spot digital assets on registered exchanges and forming a CEO Innovation Council.[1]

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce outlined a comprehensive framework on February 18, rescinding SAB 121 to ease bank custody via SAB 122.[2][5] The SEC-CFTC Harmonization Initiative targets jurisdictional clarity, with focus on tokenized securities taxonomy.[1][2] Treasury's GENIUS Act rulemaking on stablecoins, including AML and tax rules, ramps up in early 2026.[1]

DOJ ceased targeting exchanges for user actions absent fraud, and Treasury lifted Tornado Cash sanctions.[2] CFTC reissued Letter 25-40, refining payment stablecoin definitions for collateral use.[3] These moves democratize digital assets, reducing enforcement and boosting market access.[1][2]

## ETF Flows Signal Caution Amid Market Volatility

Spot Bitcoin ETFs faced heavy selling pressure. Five straight weeks of outflows totaled $3.8 billion, pressuring BTC price downward.[7] Bitcoin tumbled 3-5% early Monday, dipping under $65,000 to $64,300 after $434 million in long liquidations.[4][7][8]

Trump's 15% global tariff hike sparked uncertainty, with Supreme Court nixing some tariffs adding to volatility.[6][8] US futures fell alongside BTC, while Asian markets mixed.[6] Investors fled speculative assets amid trade war fears.[8]

This week's data underscores ETF sensitivity to macro events. Outflows contrast 2025 inflows, highlighting shifting sentiment.[7]

## Institutional Adoption Accelerates

Banks now custody crypto more freely post-SAB 122, which grants discretion on balance sheet treatment.[2] FRB, OCC, and FDIC rescinded anti-crypto guidance, enabling customer services.[2] CFTC allows tokenized collateral like stablecoins on derivatives markets.[1]

SEC terminated cases like Coinbase's alleged unregistered securities sales.[2] CLARITY Act progresses in Senate, promising CFTC-SEC delineation.[1] New CFTC Chairman Selig eyes swift implementation if passed.[1]

Stablecoin rules under GENIUS Act limit non-bank issuance but offer exemptions via SCRC.[2] Banking lobby pushes reward bans, setting 2026 battles.[1] Tokenized securities frameworks emerge, drawing institutions.[2]

## What to do next

Secure your Bitcoin holdings with self-custody to navigate regulatory flux and volatility. Use a hardware wallet like [Ledger](https://shop.ledger.com/?r=92d74dc2847a) for offline private key storage, generate a seed phrase securely, and verify addresses before transfers. Practice multisig setups for larger stacks, avoid sharing recovery details, and test small transactions first—empowering true ownership beyond ETFs or exchanges.
